# Conformational effects in binding affinity of RIPK2 inhibitor

This repo looks at the absolute binding free energy difference in two different poses of compound 5 from [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00575). 

The two poses are found in crystal structures [6RNA](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6rna) and [5J7B](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5J7B). 

The protocol will follow a similar protocol to the one found in [this paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/83368#s4) and this uses [Biosimspace](https://biosimspace.openbiosim.org/).
